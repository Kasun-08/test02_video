<h1>About Kyoto</h1>

<img style="height: 50%; width: 50%;" src="photo\kyoto_prefecture.jpg">

<p style=" width: 75%;" >Kyoto was the capital of Japan for over 1,000 years, beginning in 794, when Emperor Kammu made the city the seat of his Imperial court and the center of Japan's political world. This long and prestigious history led to the development of many of the refined arts we now associate with Japan.
Having escaped the ravages of World War II, the city is a treasure trove of important cultural properties. Kyoto is dotted with over 2,000 shrines and temples, which contain about 20% of Japan's National Treasures and about 14% of its Important Cultural Assets; 17 places in the city are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<br>

Many aspects of traditional culture have been carefully preserved since the Heian period. Kyoto people are justifiably proud of their traditions, including omotenashi, or traditional hospitality, as well as kaiseki ryori, food beautiful enough to be called art, and many others. Various seasonal events are held throughout the year when one can glimpse the noble heritage of this beautiful, ancient city.<br>

It’s not just in the pristine air in the bamboo groves or in the green forests surrounding the city. There is something very serene about Kyoto, deeply embedded in its everyday life.<br>

Kyoto has nurtured its elegant simplicity in parallel with its aesthetics of cleanliness and purity for centuries. Utmost refinement is accompanied by a sense of purity. In Kyoto, that’s not just about the ideal atmosphere, but also in the actual practices integrated into the way of living and in welcoming guests.<br></p>
